# FoodTrucker

Thank you for taking the time to check out this project. This project was designed to be a hub for a food truck operator/owner. They should be able to keep track of employees, customers, menu items, ingredients, and so much more. While the program is fairly basic right now, I can see a clear path as to how to make it better in time.

I have three goals for this project:
1. Showcase my current coding skills
2. Act as a playground to continuously develop new skills
3. Potentially use this when I open my own food truck

Feel free to play around and add any information you would like. In order to do anything, you must first register as a user. Also, there are two joining tables that function a little less fluidly than what I would like: the RecipeIngredients table, and the TransactionMenuItems table. These were both necisary in order for me to have multiples of each on other tables. In the future, I would like to code in the abiliy to add these simultaneously with their related tables, but until then, there is a certain workflow that must be followed. For RecipeIngredients, please add a Recipe and all of the requireed Ingredients, before populating the RecipeIngredients table. The same goes for the TransactionMenuItems table. A Transaction and the needed MenuItems must first be added before completing the TransactionMenuItems table.
Don't hesitate't reach out with any questions or comments on this app, and if you'd like, check back later to see how the program has changed. Thanks!
